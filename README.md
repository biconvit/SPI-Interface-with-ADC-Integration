# SPI-Interface-with-ADC-Integration
- Developed an analog-to-digital conversion system with conditional SPI transmission.
- Configured 12-bit ADC for continuous sampling (1MHz clock) with analog input from potentiometer.
- Implemented SPI2 master interface (1MHz clock) with custom configuration (IDLE high, transmission on positive edge).
- Created threshold-based trigger system to initiate SPI transmission when input voltage exceeded 2V.
- Captured and verified multi-channel digital signals using oscilloscope analysis.
